# Tree Traversal Visualization

## Overview

This project visualizes tree traversal algorithms (Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder) using HTML and CSS. It provides an interactive and educational tool for understanding how these algorithms work.

## Features

- **Inorder Traversal**: Nodes are visited in the order: Left, Root, Right.
- **Preorder Traversal**: Nodes are visited in the order: Root, Left, Right.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Nodes are visited in the order: Left, Right, Root.
- Interactive visualizations that demonstrate the traversal processes.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in your web browser.
- Select the traversal type (Inorder, Preorder, or Postorder) from the options.
- Follow the visualization to understand the traversal process.
